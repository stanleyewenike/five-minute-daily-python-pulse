# Day 3 â€” Variables & Arithmetic Operators
# Part of the Five-Minute Daily Python Pulse series

# Creating and using variables
apples = 5
oranges = 3

# Arithmetic operations
total_fruit = apples + oranges
print("Total fruit:", total_fruit)

# String concatenation
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print("Hello,", full_name)

# Basic subtraction
difference = apples - oranges
print("Fruit difference:", difference)

# Multiplication
fruit_basket = apples * 2
print("Fruit basket capacity:", fruit_basket)

# Division
fruit_ratio = apples / oranges
print("Fruit ratio:", fruit_ratio)
