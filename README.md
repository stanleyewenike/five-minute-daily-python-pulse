| 2025-08-09 | Intro to Python    | Printed hello world; strings + print. Next: variables. |
| 2025-08-10 | Variables          | Created string variables; snake_case + constants; f-strings. Next: comments, naming rules, and more variables. |
| 2025-08-11 | More on variables & arithmetic operators          | Covered creating/using variables, string concatenation, and basic arithmetic. Everything worked smoothly. Next: Boolean operators, other operators, comments, and more... |
| 2025-08-12 | Booleans, Comparisons, and f-Strings          | Learned Boolean values, equality & inequality, greater/less than checks. Explored negation and compound Boolean expressions. Next: Practise f-strings for clean, readable output, practise all other concepts learned till date... |
| 2025-08-13 | Practice Exercises Recap          | Consolidated variables, arithmetic, Booleans, and string operations. Built confidence with comparisons and concatenations. Next: More exercise, Create a simple bot greeting... |
| 2025-08-14 | More Exercises & Data Types          | Discovered Python’s `type()` function for identifying data types. Practised string comparisons. Worked on number compression (integer division & modulo). Next: Will work on creating a simple bot responding to favourite programming languages, and more... |
